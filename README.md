To conduct this experiment, you'll need to follow these steps:

Train a GAN model on the CIFAR10 dataset to generate adversarial perturbations.
Evaluate the initial accuracy of your classification model on clean CIFAR10 data.
Implement an adversarial attack using the generated perturbations and evaluate the accuracy again.
Apply APEGAN defense to mitigate the effect of the adversarial perturbations.
Evaluate the final accuracy after defense.

After the attack the accuracy will reduce and after defense the accuracy increases, close to the inital accuracy.
